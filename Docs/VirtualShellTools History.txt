
 Version 1.3.0 - 12-4-05  
 
  - Support for D2006.
  - Renamed OnAddCustomShellColumn to OnHeaderRebuild.
    OnHeaderRebuild is fired after the header gets recreated.
    Use this event to add, delete or modify the columns.
    WARNING:
      This will break your app if you used the OnAddCustomShellColumn 
      event.  You will need to change over to this new event.  Sorry.
   - Reworked the delayed shell notify handler for when a VET is dragging,
     context menu is showing or editing.  Uses less resources and is more
     robust.
   - Added background enumeration of objects in the Listview.  See the new 
     ThreadedEnum property and the EnumThreadLengthyOperation and OnEnumFinished
     events.
   - Fixed bug in IsDriveW when using "<Drive Letter>:' format.
   - Incorporated changes to make hard coded text in header dialog box and other 
     places to be changed at runtime.  Allows localization at runtime.
   - Fixed several bugs in the Threaded Enumerations
   - Fixed bug in resetting the column sort column and direction.
   - Added new option, VETOptions.MiscOptions.toPersistListviewColumnSort
   - Fixed incorrect use of compressed text color
   - TVirtualExplorerListview.BrowseToByPIDL now checks if it's necessary to 
     change the rootfolder.
   - Added ESC key handler to cancel cut or copy.

VLVEx - Version 1.4.6 

4 September 2005 
              - Made GetChildByIndex function more robust.
  	- Fixed 0000017 Mantis entry: AV when deleting file.
  	- Fixed 0000023 Mantis entry: incorrect mouse click events when
  	  HideCaptions or ComCtl6 was used.
  	- Fixed problem in CM_FONTCHANGED and Begin/End Update causing
  	  TListview to access window handle during streaming, thanks to
  	  Jim for the fix.
  	- Fixed incorrect focus painting when syncronizing the selection.
  	- Added new border styles, tbWindowed and tbFit.
  	- Added new SingleLineCaptions property to the ThumbsOptions.
  	- Added Ctrl-I shortcut to invert the selection.

 Version 1.2.5
    - 8-27-05   - Added foShareable and foNetworkPrinters for the enumeration property
               - Fixed bug when renaming folders and causing sub-objects
                 to be invalid during a refresh
               - Ignore Mapped Drive shell notifier was not excluding mapped
                 drive notifications as required.
               - Made the
                   VirtualShellNotifyRefreshRate: Integer = 750;  // milliseconds
                 a variable so it can be set to any value in code
               - Fixed bug introduced in last release, AV on shut down

  Version 1.2.3
     - 8.20.05 - Fixed long standing issue of the context menu cursor turning
                 into an hourglass
               - Fixed issue of refreshing trees when one is editing.  Now defers
                 the WM_SHELLNOTIFY message until the drag, or edit is over instead
                 of forcing a refresh on the entire tree it uses the actual message
                 sent so that unnecessary refreshing is eliminated    
    
     - 6.18.05 - The time is here, Data Execution Prevention (DEP) requires
                 executable code to not be in the data segment.  The CreateStub
                 function used New() to allocate this but new processers would
                 not execute this memory.  It now uses VirutalAlloc if VIRTUALMEMSTUB
                 define is used.  It is enabled by default in this unit.
               - Changed licence to match VirtualTreeview
               - Changed the way the Include files work.  There is no longer
                 a defined path to them.  The installer will add path to the include
                 files to the IDE Library or Browse paths.  This is because every
                 package Soft-Gems and Mustangpeak has use common include files
                 and keeping them in sync is a pain.  This means that it may be
                 necessary to add a path to the Include folder within the IDE.
               - Fixed bug where VET would try to focus a node even if the tree
                 was not visible
               - Fixed bug where Toolbar buttons would not loose the hottrack
                 state when the mouse moved off from them.
               - Added the capability of Large Icons in the Toolbars
              - Added PopupMenu property to the Toolbars
               - I used a hack to make the right alignemnt work for the hidden
                 Recycle Bin folders in the size column. This breaks normal
                 hidden folders and the right align in the size column.  Now
                 normal hidden folders will work and the hidden Recycle Bin
                 folders will be wrong.
               - Fixed DragDetectPlus function.  Caused strange behavior in the
                 Toolbars when trying to right drag on a button for rearranging
                 or removal.

    - 01-10-05 - Fixed issue where images were not cached and being reloaded
                 every paint cycle
               - Refixed TNamespace.DetailsOf by wrapping it with SetErrorMode
                 for Empty CD drive issues //
             - Added new option: toExecuteOnDblClkFullRow to allow for the
                 default action to the executed for a dbl click anywhere on
                 an item if the tree is is full row select. 
    - 12-24-04 - Fixed bug with event not firing for VEL on Paste


  Version 1.2.0
    - 12-14-04 - Fixed the problem with the Toolbar Images getting messed up
                 when a notification event occurs! Whoo-Hoo!
                - Fixed the problem where the treeview may lose it place during
                  a shell event and reset to no expanded nodes! Whoo-Hoo*2!
    - 11-10-04 - Fixed the fix from Robert and the focused node <G>.  It was
                 begin saved but not restored and it corrupted the stream.
    - 11-28-04 - Fixed bug in text color when full row selection on
                 and column > 1.  When selected columns > 1 text did not
                 respect the selected text color.
               - Added code to log shell notifications if {$DEFINE LOGSHELLEVENTS}
                 is enabled to find long standing annoying issues with refresh.
               - Started updating to VT 4.2.23, issues found. Talking with Mike.
                 Not backwards compatible must upgrade VT with new version of VSTools.
               - Fixed the TNamespace.ShowContextMenu so that the context menu
                 would show owner draw submenus it the Owner passed is not a
                 VET or decendent
               - Added an Active property to the Combobox.  WARNING its default
                 is not Active so you must set to true.

  Version 1.1.17
    - 6-21-04 - Fixed VirtualRedirector to take parameters to the process
    - 8-30-04 - Robert fixed the focused node not being saved in the VETPersistent object

  Version 1.1.16
        - 4.11.04 - Added Caching for the Overlay Indexed in TNamespace
        - 3.17.04 - Fixed bug in the Context Menu injection code where looking for a Unique
                    menu ID would never break out of the loop.
        - 3.29.04 - Fixed bug if RootChanging returns False for Allow in the Listview.
                    The root PIDL would be destroyed regardess and be nil.
        - 4.23.04 - Fixed bug in the Injected context menu where my code to find
                    a unique menu ID failed.
        - 4.23.04 - Added new default parameter to the BrowseToXXXX methods,
                    ShowAllSiblings.  If false the tree will only create a branch
                    of folders to a particular object.  Any siblings of each branch
                    will not be shown.  See how Explorer finds a network path
                    by typing it directly into the address bar.
        - 4.23.04 - Enhancements to the VirtualDataObject.pas file to allow
                    for the shell info to be placed on the clipboard without destroying
                    what was already on the clipboard

*******************************************
NOTICE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
*******************************************
  As you can see VSTools is now has an installer.  As 
such please remove all traces of VSTools from your Delphi 
installation.

1) Go to:

   Component > Install Packages 

   Select VirtualShellTools and press"Remove"
   Select VirtualListviewEx and press "Remove"

2) To to: 

   Tools > Enviroment Options > Library > Library Paths

   Remove the all paths to the current installation of VSTools

3) Go to where you currently have VSTools installed.  Delete 
   the entire Folder and all traces of VSTools.

4) Run the new installer and it will:

    a) create a new install folder (Mustangpeak root)
    b) add all necessary paths to Delphi
    c) Build all packages and put them in the folder
       designated as the BPL/DCP output by Delphi.
    d) Install VSTools into the IDE

   Right now BCB simply copies the BCB folder to the install 
   directory, since I don't have BCB I will need some assistance
   completing the same for CBuilder.

NOTE:
  The directory structure of VSTools has been changed.

VLVEx Version 1.4.2

23 May 2004 - version 1.4.2
  - Added support for toHideOverlay and toRestoreTopNodeOnRefresh 
    properties.
  - Added new property: ThumbsOptions.CacheOptions.CacheProcessing 
    to allow ascending or descending sorting of the thread cache 
    processing list. When this property is tcpAscending the top 
    files in the listview are thumbnailed first.
  - Fixed incorrect selection painting, it now uses the values in
    Colors.FocusedSelectionColor and Colors.UnFocusedSelectionColor.
  - Fixed an incorrect call to OnEditCancelled.
  - Reworked the internal cache events.

//  Version 1.1.15
//        - Fixed bug where Tree was rebuilt while a reference to the Namespace 
//          contained in the tree was still held, causing an AV.  This will likely
//          solve my long standing AV during a refresh and a shell notify event.
//        - Fixed problem when creating a new folder in a VELV then hitting enter
//          to browse to the folder before the attaced Treeview is updated with
//          the new folder.  Now the treeview node is refreshed before the VELV
//          is browsed to.
//        - When autoexpand is enabled collapsing a node left the focus and selection
//          in the collapsed branch (using the "+").  Fixed
//        - Added OnCreateButtons and OnReCreateButtons events for the ShellToolbars
//        - Added new option for the Toolbars toUserDefinedClickAction so if
//          not connected to a VSTools control it won't open the default Shell action
//          for the object
//        - Added a new option, VETImageOptions > toHideOverlay to turn off the
//          implememtation of IShellIconOverlay
//        - Added new option to TreeOptions.VETMiscOptions: toRestoreTopNodeOnRefresh
//          to keep tree from scrolling back to top when a shell notify refresh occurs.
//          Allows VET to not change scroll position on Refresh.
//
//  Version 1.1.14
//        - Fixed support for IShellIconOverlay
//        - Fixed the gathering of Column Detail handlers
//  Version 1.1.13
//        - Added support for IShellIconOverlay
//        - TCustomVirtualExplorerCombobox.GetPath now returns the NameforParsing for
//           all OS.
//        - Ensured support for 64 bit with the CreateStub and DisposeStub functions
//
//  Version 1.1.12c
//        - Fixed Selection and visiblilty problem in WalkPIDLToNode (through ForceNode)
//
//  Version 1.1.12c Beta
//        - Fixed a couple of annoying bugs with the VCB AutoComplete dropdown
//
//  Version 1.1.12b
//    11-9-03
//        - Fixed a few mistakes in the new toVETReadOnly implementation
//
//  Version 1.1.12a
//     9-29-03
//        - Made some mysterious changes to the Unicode Controls unit.
//          One in MakeWMCharMsgSafeForAnsi and another in TWinControlTrap.DefWin32Proc
//          Since I am FAR from an expert on this subject (it is Troy's TNT code)
//          I added the suggestions based on it is completely conceivable that
//          Windows could have a bug in this WM_CHAR message <G>.
//    11-6-03
//        - Added a TreeOptions.VETMiscOptions > toVETReadOnly option.  VT's ReadOnly
//          option is too different from what I wanted that I created a new one.
//          With ReadOnly on the tree will not respond to keycommands, mouse commands,
//          or context menu commands that would allow changes to the file system
//
//          Allows descendants (like VLVEx) to stop user actions if the Tree is VETReadOnly
//
//        - Fixed bug with folder enumeration when show hidden folders is off and
//          a folder contains only hidden folders
//
//        - Changed the default options of the combobox so it will not autoscroll
//          horizontally automatically
//
//        - Fixed VirtualCombobox to look disabled when the control is disabled
//          There seems to be a bug that does not paint the background of the edit
//          frame gray when disabled but the text is grayed and the dropdown
//          button is grayed.
//
//        - Added a new protected function for Robert:
//            function IsAnyEditing: Boolean; virtual;
//          so he can override it to let VET know if VLVEx is editing or not for
//          so it will not refresh on a shell notify if the user is editing
//
//
//  Version 1.1.12
//     9-25-03
//        - Fixed bug in WalkPIDLToNode when a parent folder had the same name
//          as a child folder
//
//  Version 1.1.11
//     9-24-03
//        - Added an OnNamespaceStructureChange event that is called when ever
//          VET adds or deletes an item in the tree.
//        - Fixed several small bugs and memory leak in the Listview
//
//     9-23-03
//        - Added Roberts code for a Flat and BorderStyle property in the ExplorerListview
//
//     6-12-03
//        - Fixed small memory leak if using EnumFolder and returning False a lot
//        - Fixed logic error in TCustomVirtualExplorerTree.DragOver and
//          TCustomVirtualExplorerTree.DragEnter to allow custom handing of the
//          drag drop
//	    - Fixed inconsistancy in Right Click context menu operation to match Explorer
//		NOTE:  This requires a change in the VT Source as of VT 3.8.3
//			 See the ReadMe.txt file in the Zip package
//
//     5-11-03
//        - Fixed "missing" scrollbar in ExplorerCombo boxes on first roll down
//          in rare instances
//        - Added two methods to VET, VELV, VETV
//            function ForceNode(APath: WideString; Expand: Boolean): PVirtualNode;
//            function ForceNodeByPIDL(APIDL: PItemIDList; Expand: Boolean): PVirtualNode;
//          They force the tree to expand to find the passes PIDL or Path.  If Expand
//          is false then the nodes are created and expanded but the UI does not
//          display them, i.e. the branch is left collapsed during the process
//
//     5-4-03
//        - Enhanced the BrowseToXXX methods to work for paths with filenames as
//          well as folders
// 
//     5-2-03
//        - Fixed bug in toListviewLimitBrowseToRoot where the listview could browse
//          above its initial root folder.
//
//     5-1-03
//        - Memory leaks in TWideStringList fixed, thanks Robert and Hideo Koiso
//
//  Version 1.1.10
//     4-28-03
//        - Fixed bug where the cached IShellFolder may miss a new folder created
//          under a recently created folder during a WM_SHELLNOTIFY ReReadAndRefreshNode
//          call.
//
//     4-27-03
//        - Fixed bug when pasting to the desktop in Win2k
//        - Added toUserSort and published the OnCompareNodes property to allow
//          for custom sorting of nodes
//
//     4-7-03
//        - VT seems to have changed the way it handles right clicks.  Does not
//          select the node if VETMiscOption > toRightButtonSelect is off. Reworked
//          the right click context menu actions to be more like Explorer
//
//  Version 1.1.9
//     4-1-03
//        - Changes in RebuildRootNamespace where the hidden node's TNamespace
//          was not being freed
//
//     3-28-03
//        - Reworked the auto calculated Explorer ComboHeight to allow the edit
//          to be sized smaller than 23 pixels.  It will now go down to the
//          size of the image (16).
//
//     3-25-03
//        - Added the focused node to the VETPersistent class to save the Focused node
//          in the tree state to be restored later
//
//     3-20-03
//        - Changed all LoadLibrary to GetModuleHandle to eliminate orphaned
//          dll's due to reference counting.  The dll's needed are the common
//          dll's that will be staticlly linked with other functions anyway so
//          there is no reason to use LoadLibrary.
//
//     3-6-03
//        - Fixed ScrollIntoView problem with the BrowseTo methods.
//
//     - Robert: Fixed a problem with the TWideStringList, it saved the strings on unicode
//       format even on W9x, making it unreadable for non-unicode systems.
//     - Fixed bugs with TWideStringList.IndexOfName and TCacheList.GetCacheFileToSave
//       under Win9x.  They were using lstrcmpiW which is only avaiable under NT.
//       Thanks to Eric Fookes for finding finding this.
//
//  Version 1.1.8
//    2.19.03
//      - Fixed Windows Shutdown problem on Win9x.
//      - Improved Shell Notifications to work with 9x in the "My Documents" folder
//        that is under the desktop
//      - Extensive upgrades in VLVEx see the source file for details.
//
//  Version 1.1.7
//    1.30.03
//      - Fixed bug with Toolbar2000 and TBSkins.  AV with VET in floating window
//        on shutdown.
//
//    1.28.03
//      - Fixed "Can not focus a hidden or disabled window" problem with the Combobox
//        in an OCX.
//      - Added new option to ExplorerCombobox: vcboSelectPathOnDropDown.  If true
//        when the combo is dropped down the path in the edit is automaticlly selected,
//        if not it mimics explorer.
//      - Added appropriate TMenu.PopupComponent assignments for VET Popup Menus.
//
//    1.27.03 PM
//      - Separated the IMalloc in the Image thread.  I was using this interface in
//        various threads without marshalling it!  Could be cause of past no draws
//        of images and mysterous AV's
//      - Enhanced ComboBox with Focus/Selection that mimics explorer edit before and
//        after RollDown.
//      - Fixed bug with new Combobox Rolldown implementation. Would re-rolldown when
//        clicking the dropdown button expecting it to close the rolldown.
//
//    1.27.03 AM
//      - Fixed bug in ExplorerComboBox in enhanced mode.  When expanding/collapsing
//        the scrollbar was not updated correctly.
//      - Added more tree navigation keys to the ExplorerComboBox in enhanced mode that
//        are passed to the VET and now do not close the dropdown.
//  Version 1.1.6
//    1.26.03
//      - Completely reworked the ComboBox drop down to allow it to work correctly
//        in an active form.  Switched from the VCL type WndProc hooks to a local
//        message loop.  Much more clear and concise.
//      - Bug fix when asking for lower case letters for the Attributes column
//    1.23.03
//      - Fixed issue with speed of ShellColumn mode when using custom column.
//        I was asking the Shell Namespace for the details of the custom column
//        which made them take a lot of time trying to decide what to do with
//        a column index greater than they were expecting, making the screen
//        refresh really sluggish.
//    1.20.03
//      - Fixed bug in the VET Persistent stream reading and writing
//      - Added new option TreeOption.VETMiscOptions-toShowCompressedInAttributes
//          When enabled adds a "C" to the attribute string in details mode.
//          NOTE: Only works for VET and UserDefined Columns.  In Shell Columns mode
//                the shell decides what goes in that column.
//      - Upped the prioritity to the image thread to normal, it was unintentionally
//        set to idle.
//
//    1.17.03
//      - Made Combobox Path published.
//      - Updated the WideEdit in the ComboBox with Troys lastest code to try to
//        solve some issues when used with other components that hook the windows
//        WindowProc.
//      - Changed all instances of TFileStream to TWideFileStream since Robert
//        quietly slipped it into VirtualWideStrings.pas.   Again thanks to
//        Troy and his TNT package.
//      - Fixed issue when VET is used in a Frame that is created dynamiclly the
//        images thread may loose some images.  Due to fact that the VCL is recreating
//        the window and that causes the image thread reference to count do 0 and
//        free itself after a few image have been cached. Added calls in CreateWnd
//        to ensure everything is reloaded.
//      - Added new VETMiscOption: toRemoveContextMenuShortCut.
//        A Folder only treeview connected to a listview should not have shortcut
//        item as the short cut is created in the parent of the tree item, as is should be,
//        but the listview is in the folder so it appears nothing happened.  Explorer
//        removes the Shortcut item from the menu. This option allows the same effect.
//  Version 1.1.5
//
//  12.29.02
//      - Fixed issue with Change Notifiers using interfaces accessed across threads
//        without marshalling.  Could be cause of infrequent mysterous AV with notifer
//        seen (by me) recently.
//      - Finally found why VET apps won't let Windows shut down.  Added WM_QUERYENDSESSION
//        handler in the Listener window created to funnel the change notifies to
//        the main thread.
//      - Fixed Deadlock issue with the Kernel Notifier thread
//      - Fixed Reference counting bug with the Kernel Notifier thread
//
//  12.28.02
//      - Fixed bug: SelectedPathsW and SelectedFilesW where never created!
//
//  12.16.02
//      - Forced a Form paint update after the combobox is rolled up before
//        any slow processing takes place.  Looks more professional rather than
//        having the drawing update hang up in the middle waiting for the roll
//        up to finish.
//
//  Version 1.1.4 Beta
//
//  12.14.02
//      - Fixed problem with combobox in Win9x.  After rolldown if dialog popped
//        immediately after it went behind the form.
//	- Reworked ShellNotifiers to use referenced counted threads.  This was to ensure
//        the threads where terminated before the ShellNotifier object was destroyed in
//        finalization section of the unit.  If not the threads would deadlock due to
//	  serialization of DLLs when VET was used in a COM object.
//  12.13.02
//      - Added 3 new properties to TNamespace:
//          property LastAccessTime  : TDateTime read GetLastAccessTime;
//          property LastWriteTime   : TDateTime read GetLastWriteTime;
//          property CreationTime    : TDateTime read GetCreationTime;
//      - Forgot to set the default Handled to False in CopyToClipBoard
//      - Combined instances of
//          function CreateStub(ObjectPtr: Pointer; MethodPtr: Pointer): Pointer;
//          procedure DisposeStub(Stub: Pointer);
//        into the VirtualUtilites.pas file
//
//  Version 1.1.3
//
//  12.12.02
//      - I think Robert found the problem with the images coming in slow
//        and why the My Picture image was wrong.  The thread never could
//        use IShellIcon to extract the icon because I was passing it the
//        the wrong PIDL. This happened between 1.0.5 and 1.1
//        Thanks Robert.
//      - Robert extended the capabilites of TWideStringList by addes associated
//        Objects to each string.
//      - Robert updated the packages to better represent the VSTools Common from
//        the VSTools components.
//      - **** VLV By Robert ****
//      - Added the latest VLVEx from Robert:
//      - Reworked the cache mechanism, improved thumbnails creation and
//        painting speed.
//      - Added new public method for cache cleaning, ThumbsCacheOptions.ClearCache
//      - Added new public method for cache item reload, ThumbsCacheOptions.Reload
//      - Added new property, ThumbsCacheOptions.CompressionQuality, to
//        control the thumbnail compression, default value of 60 (1..100, 1 highest
//        compression but lowest quality, 100 lowest compression but highest quality).
//      - Updated demo.
//      - **** End VLV By Robert ****
//  Version 1.1.2
//
//  12.11.02
//      - Fixed issues with CreateNewFolderXXXX and autoselecting of the file
//        for editing.  In Win98 it appears that the actual creation of the file
//        can be delayed till after CreateDir returns and as such VET can't find
//        the new folder to edit.  Added a loop to wait for the new folder to
//        appear (with a "SafteyValve" to quit looking after a second or two)
//        Thanks Boris for being persistent till I duplicated it.
//      - Implemented my own thread class to get rid of WaitFor which has been
//        troublesome forever.  Now VET DLL in other processes won't hang up
//        the the app closes and the DLL unloads.
//      - Added an AFTEREDITDELAY constant in VirtualExplorerTree.pas that forces
//        a wait after enter is pressed to try to delay VET enough to let the
//        ChangeNotifies pass such that the tree will keep the newly created
//        node on the bottom of the list and not do a refresh and resort it.
//
//  12.8.02
//      - Fixed inconsistancy in various flavors of Windows.
//          function TNamespace.GetNameForParsing: WideString;
//          function TNamespace.GetNameForParsingInFolder: WideString;
//        may or may not return the full real path for the Desktop on the
//        Desktop TNamespace.  They will always now return the
//        physical path for the Desktop
//
//  12.5.02
//      - Let PIDLs be collected (although incorrectly) from various folders
//        in TNamespace.ShowContextMenuMulti. It is the apps responsiblity to
//        parse out the right selection by hooking to menu with the Menu Events
//        See the FileFind demo.
//
//  12.02.02
//      - TPopupAutoCompleteDropDown.AlwaysShow has been depreciated and removed.
//        its function was inconsistant and no longer valid it its original context.
//        There is an OnAutoCompleteRollDown event that can be used to stop the rolldown
//      - Fixed Unused function in VirtualShellUtilities.pas in D5
//      - Added stubs for ExcludeTrailingPathDelimiter and IncludeTrailingPathDelimiter
//        in VirtualWideStrings.pas that are defined only if using D5. This allows
//        demos to use these functions and still work with D5 (if they use the
//        VirtualWideStrings.pas unit)
//
//  Version 1.1
//
//  12.01.02
//      - Checked compatibilty with VT 3.5.7
//      - Many updates for the VirtualNamespace with a partially working Zip
//        extenstion in the demos, thanks to Gerard Slurink.  A full working
//        version is on the horizon.
//      - Added override events for CutToClipboard, CopyToClipboard, and
//        PasteFromClipboard, CreateDaataObject.  This allows for objects
//        from different folders to be saved to the dataobject, removing the
//        constraint of only child objects of a folder being saved to the
//        dataobject.  The implementer is responsible for adding the appropriate
//        structure and data to the IDataObject.  A File Search demo will soon
//        be available to demonstrate this feature.
//      - Added a Handled property in the TVirtualShellEvent class.  This allows
//        for the application to handle the refresh of the VET in the OnShellNotify
//        event.  Simply set
//            ShellEvent.Handled := True;
//        and VET will not try to update the tree during a notify.
//
//  11.26.02
//      - Added Roberts change for when a selected node is deleted. VET now selects the
//        the next sibling before resorting to selecting the parent node.  This is
//        mainly for the listview mode and mimics Explorer.
//
//  11.18.02
//      - Added toRightButtonSelect to VETMiscOptions to mimic the explorer Listview
//        For various reasons I had to override VT's right buttons select Options and
//        make it true all the time.  Use this one instead.
//
//  Version 1.0.5
//  11.10.02
//      - Fixed ComboBox TabStop property default value set wrong in constructor
//      - Fixed ComboBox could not set focus through code
//      - Fixed issue with autocomplete with empty string when debugging app in
//        IDE, stopped exeception
//      - Fixed bug with IShellList that kept sending change notificiations when
//        reading the link.
//      - Created a new class, TShellSortHelper, in VirtualShellUtilites to
//        allows those using custom columns to have access to the same sorting
//        routines VET uses.  They automaticlly handle the details of sorting
//        folders and files separately
//
//  Version 1.0.4
//  11.06.02
//      - Published new VT property SelectionBlendFactor;
//      - Fixed bug in TPIDLList, was not freeing the List for the PIDL's
//      - Fixed bug when browsing between two folder of the same name but in
//        different branches. The linked control would not browse as it interperted
//        it as being in the same folder.
//
//      - Robert updated VLVEx
//      - The cache file is now compressed and the size is reduced by 10 times,
//        thanks to Gerald Koeder for the tip.
//      - Improved the cache management, introduced a new property ThumbsCacheOptions.
//      - The cache will now be automatically loaded/saved when
//        ThumbsCacheOptions.AutoLoad/AutoSave is true.
//       - ThumbWidth and ThumbHeight now reflect the real pixel size of the thumbnail.
//       - Improved the demo.
//
//  Version 1.0.3
//  11.05.02
//      - Fixed bug when switching back from large images
//      - Fixed bug with Notifier Thread and a race condition when using
//        RegisterKernelSpecialFolderWatch (may have been Roberts problem the
//        other day)
//      - Used Roberts SendTo Menu unit that supports Toolbar2000 and TBX
//      - Fixed bug with colors in VExplorerCombo to match what Delphi does with
//        themes.
//
//  Version 1.0.2
//  11.04.02
//      - Fixed bug with Cut/Copy Marking
//      - Added nil check for a strange problem Robert has seen a couple of
//        times in procedure TVirtualChangeNotifier.ListenerWndProc
//      - Added compatiblity changes for BCB
//
//  Version 1.0.1
//
//  11.02.02
//      - Compatibility with VT 3.5.1 performed. No changes necessray
//      - DFM now does not store the columns info if in ShellColums since they
//        are dynamiclly rebuild depending on where the current root folder is
//
//  10.31.02
//      - Fixed bug in Send To Menu when selecting a Send To Item that is a link
//
//  10.26.02
//      - A few more adjustments to the Shell Notifier to catch some special circumstances
//
//  10.21.02
//      - Added custom exception object in the TNamespace.CreateFromFileName constructor
//        so it can be easily turned off during debugging through the IDE
//
//  10.14.02
//      - Centralized all System ImageLists to the VirtualSystemImageLists.pas objects
//
//   Version 1.0
//
//  10.13.02
//      - Added an OnAddButton event to the VirtualShellToolbars to selectivly
//        leave out particular drives
//      - Added a RebuildToolbar to the VirtualShellToolbars to force buttons
//        to be recreated
//
//  10.6.02
//      - Robert fixed VirtualUnicodeControls so Mikes ThemeManager can work with it
//        now. Basiclly implemented Troy's latest TNT code
//      -Robert fixed a few more selection bugs in VLVEx
//
//  Version 1.0 RC3
//
//  10.6.02
//      - Added support of ghosted Cut images.  This required two things:
//          1) VT Version 3.4.13  (Thanks Mike for making the changes I needed)
//          2) Breaking existing code for those who show context menus programmaticlly
//             I added a new callback paramameter, all you need to do is pass a "nil"
//      - Cleaned up the "Versions" All VSTools files are version 1.0 now
//      - The Kernel Shell Notify thread now can register special folders to watch
//        as well, using
//          ChangeNotifier.RegisterKernelSpecialFolderWatch(CSIDL_DESKTOP)
//        for instance.  This will cause the Kernel Shell Notify thread to detect
//        a change in the physical file folder and map it to both a Notification
//        for the physical file, PLUS as notification for the Virtual Desktop.
//        With this system it is possible to use only the Kernel Notification System
//        to monitor changes in all File folders, virtual or real.  It will not detect
//        things like media change, printer status changes etc.  for that it is still
//        necessary to use the Shell Notification system.
//
//      - Reworked the Notification system to try to minimize time needed to process
//        thousands of file operations.... again.  The last attempt tried to minimize
//        VET's effect on Explorer by not blocking Explorer at all on a notification.
//        The notifications were stored and processed later. This causes VET to
//        need to sort through a lot of information and appear to hang for a while
//        after the operation was complete.  Since VET's effect on the Explorer notification
//        is minimal compared to the actual operation (confirmed now that I used
//        an optimizer to track times) it is better to process the notifies during
//        the operation so a minimal data set is maintained by the VET notification threads.
//
//  Version 1.0 RC2a
//
//  10.6.02
//      - Added support for CTL-UP/DOWN and CTL-PAGEUP/PAGEDOWN
//
//  09.22.02
//      - Fixed CreateFolder varients so they work with the Desktop and Desktop
//         sub folders
//      - Number of small bug and non standard compiler option fixes (thanks to Milan)
//
//  09.12.02
//      - ShellToolbars now aware of the ExplorerComboBox
//      - Fixed bug at design time with Toolbars not unlinking with VET or Combobox if
//        the other control was deleted from Form
//      - Created new AutoComplete component (for the file select autocomplete like
//          when typing in the combo box of explorer and VSTools comobo box.
//           NOTE: Only works with newer versions of the Common Controls (IE 4.0 or so)
//              This inteface is flaky and buggy. The options to select what is displayed
//              in the list works one way on some OS's and a different way on a another OS.
//              Eventually need to implement it so it always works the right way by doing
//              some the work myself.
//      - Reworked the AutoComplete list callback event so it is easy to fill the
//        list with the normal autocomplete strings before modifing the list.  Does not
//        break existing code just makes it easier to do the that task
//
//  09.04.02
//      - Optimized the ChangeNotifier so it is *much* faster when tracking large (1000's)
//        file operations.
//      - Change notifier now work much better/faster in the RecycleBin
//      - Bug fixes in VirtualShellHistory
//      - Finished implementing the new Icon Thread (single thread for all controls)
//          added threaded images to toolbars and Combobox
//      - Enabled Vert autoscroll in combo enhanaced mode
//      - Milan is back!  Implemented changes to allow BCB to compile latest version
//      - Fixed problem with D7 and VirtualExplorerListviewEx thumb thread, thank you Robert.
//
//  09.03.02
//      - Fixed bugs with the new threading routines for icons and notifiers, thanks Robert.
//      - Optimization of Notify thread for NT4 when deleting large number of files.
//      - Fixed bug with VLVEx thumbnail thread and D7.  Just a guess, seems to work, need to get real
//        D7 and look at the thread source to see what has changed.
//  09.01.02
//      - Updated VSTools for D7 Compatiblitly!!!!!
//      - Removed the OLEDragManager from the package because of D7 compatibility/bugs (Trail Version Only)
//        I don't want to support it anymore as I don't really like the way it was done.
//      - Implemented necessary changes to make the VirtualNamespaces a reality and they
//        works SLICK!  Better yet the classes that you derive from to create the virtual
//        namespace get to about 75% of the way to a REAL namespace extentsion for Explorer!
//        These classes allows everything except Context Menus.. well you can do context menus
//        but they must be done with 100% API.  Because of the way the VCL deals with TPopupMenus
//        it is not easy to hook a TPopupMenu to a shell context menu (VCL creates Item ID automaticlly,
//        Shell menus send a range of values that the Item ID's must fall under)
//      - Created a new include file.  It allows more flexabilty in what is linked into
//        the VSTools package.  These are done through conditional defines.  By default
//        the VirtualNamespaces are NOT enabled so they WILL effect performance. Also
//      - Reworked the Image Thread.  Now one thread is shared across all controls.
//      - ImageThread Priority can be now set using ImageThreadManager.SetThreadPriority in
//        the VirtualIconThread.pas file
//      - Included some bug fixes/enhancements in the VirtualToolbars from Robert Lee, thanks as usual
//      - Added a number of conditional defines to strip pieced of VET out of the
//        package.  This produced the following results in D5:
//            Basic Form - 307kB
//            Basic Form with 1 VT - 574kB
//            Basic Form with 1 VET - 792kB
//            Basic Form with 1 VET stripped down package - 659kB
//              This produces a basic file/folder browser with no refresh capability
//        This whole idea is experimental and I have not tested the actual functionality
//        of any of the controls with pieces stripped out.  The main focus of this
//        was to block it off to get D4 to compile <G>
//        The result produced the follown analysis of the project:
//              VirtualExplorerTree.pas    54,113 (summary)
//              VirtualPIDLTools.pas          900 (summary)
//              VirtualResources.pas        1,584 (summary)
//              VirtualShellUtilities.pas  28,037 (summary)
//              VirtualTrees.pas          161,337 (summary)
//              VirtualUtilities.pas          124 (summary)
//              VirtualWideStrings.pas      2,096 (summary)
//        It does not appear there is much more to gain from VET or VSU.  The rest
//        of the size comes from sections of the VCL being pulled into the project
//        with VET. I tried to remove these with the conditional defines as well
//
//
//  08.23.02
//      - Bought new digital camera.  Found VET did not refresh right when removing
//        a removable disk (FLASH Card).  Finally got to see some new Shell Notify
//        types!  It also fixed a refresh problem with CD's that I never noticed.
//
//  Version 1.8.276 Release Candidate 2
//
//  08.22.02
//      - The background threads for the Shell Notification have been reworked and
//        are much more efficient and clean.  They have been broken out of the
//        VirtualShellUtilities.pas file and placed in their own unit VirtualShellNotifier.pas
//        After a struggle with the unhappiness this may create I have broken your code
//        if you are using the stand alone functions that allow you to Watch a folder above
//        and beyond what the shell notification was doing.  The watch thread uses the
//        documented FindFirstChangeNotification API.  The first attempt was a hack
//        on top of what was there, the undocumented SHChangeNotify registration.  Now
//        you may register a TWinContol with one, or the other, or both systems
//        The default is only using the SHChangeNotify thread.  To use the "Kernel"
//        notification the global functions are replaced with global ChangeNotifier object
//        that you register the Kernel change with.  Then you may change the watch folder.
//        See the "Shell Notify" demo.  A few names changed in the events too for
//        type.  The change should be basiclly to add a "Virtual" to the front of
//        unknown types or a "v", for example sneMkDir is now vsneMkDir.  The changes should
//        not be too bad to update as it is not likely there is more than a few lines of
//        code in an app for this mechinisim.  Also the VirtualShellNotifier.pas file
//        must be added to the form unit if you are using any of the ShellNofiy stuff
//        in the app.
//      - Fixed Refresh bug when using CustomRootPaths in VET, ExplorerTree, and ExplorerList
//
//  08.21.02
//      - Fixed bug in ExplorerCombo that during creation of the component in code
//        the Edit box was created with a 0 height, due to the fact that the DesignTime
//        name was not present to calculate a proper height based.
//      - Fixed bug in ExplorerCombo NT4 shows Desktop/Folder1/....  when you
//        retrive the Path.  Seems Namespace.NameAddressBar in NT4 give you this
//        strange string.  NT4 now uses Namespace.ForParsing.  Newer OS will give
//        you as string of the CLSID if you use ForParsing so we can't use it for all OSs
//      - Used FreeAndNil in the finalization section on global classes and added
//        checks in the destructors of the necessary VSTools classes so a Halt(0)
//        call won't cause AV's.  This is because the VCL will call all the finalization
//        sections for the units, THEN it frees the objects on the Form causing access
//        to freed global objects.
//
//  08.20.02
//      - Fixed bug in VET InitAllChildren
//      - Fixed bug in VETPersistent when restoring
//        the special case of when the root node is hidden and no nodes are selected
//      - Added new option to catch and update Mapped Drive changes (Thanks to
//        Soren Harest for making me aware of this). This could be a rather expensive
//        update so use it wisely.  Also toChangeNotifierThread must be set too.
//
//  Version 1.8.267 Release Candidate 2
//  08.15.02
//      - Fixed "bug" in IDropTarget implementation.  WinZip is very particular
//        on exactly what Effects its IDropTarget is called with.  It gets confused
//        if you pass it all choices, copy, move, and link.  It does not know what
//        to do with too much information and just cuts back to "no drop at all" mode
//        Now only the effects that are passed to the VET window are passed on to
//        to the namespaces IDropTarget
//
//  08.13.02
//      - Fixed bug with right click on different node than selected to get context menu.
//        Explorer only temporarily selects the new node for the context menu then
//        returns to previous node.  Had to mess with the context menu manager code
//        again.  Please retest any custom popupmenu handling in your applications
//        and make sure I did not change the handling I have spend so long trying to
//        get right
//
//  Version 1.8.265 Release Candidate 2
//  08.11.02
//      - Fixed bug with streaming when trying to use Radio Buttons or non-TriState
//         checkboxes.   Increased streaming version to 2. Old file streams should
//         not be effected and automaticlly updated to version 2.
//      - VirtualExplorerListboxEx MUST have ThemeManager 1.9.0 to work properly
//
//  8.09.02
//      - Added toNoUseVETColorsProp to force VET to use the Font.Color property instead
//        of defaulting to the VETColors property.  Dumb design decision long ago
//
//  8.07.02
//      - *Really* fixed bug with ReReadAndRefreshNode adding expand buttons to trees not
//        wanting toFoldersExpandable this time!.
//
//  Version 1.8.260 Release Candidate 2
//  8.04.02
//      - Added support for TPoupMenu to be used as an injected submenu into the
//        system context menu.  See the overview demo.  It currently does not support
//        images but it should support other TMenuItem properties as well as ActionLists
//
//  8.03.02
//      - Fixed bug in the Streaming of persistent tree data (columns, user data, etc)
//
//  Version 1.8.255 Release Candidate 2
//
//  7.30.02
//      - Fixed bug in VirtualWideStrings.SumFolder, not checking for correct return
//        value with FindFirstFileW
//
//  7.23.02
//      - Image thread is now a last in first out and is a bit more efficient.  The
//        last in first out allows the current view scrolled into view get its images
//        first to update the current user screen first.
//
//  7.22.02
//      - Added toDisableGhostedFolders to VETFolderOptions to not allow
//        blended images on folders for mimicing Explorer Treeview
//
//  7.20.02
//      - Updated VirtualShellHistory so the notify events do not fire when destorying
//        saves checking for valid objects in the event handler.
//
//  7.19.02
//      - Fixed bug with ReReadAndRefreshNode adding expand buttons to trees not
//        wanting toFoldersExpandable.
//
//  Version 1.8.250 Release Candidate 2
//  7.15.02
//      - Fixed small issue with OnGetPopupMenu when no columns defined
//      - Changed default indent for comboBox dropdown to 10
//      - Opimized the ChangeNotifier to stop redundant notification calls
//      - Reworked the VirtualShellHistory unit to create a Most Recently Used (MRU)
//        class that the VirtualShellHistory is derived from
//      - Added support to write the MRU and History to the Registry
//  7.14.02
//      - Added functionality to Favorites Toolbar.  Now left click dragging off
//        from toolbar will remove the button from the toolbar
//      - Added ability in VirtualDriveToolbar to show/hide Removable (Floppy), ReadOnly
//          (CD), and Fixed (HardDrive) Drives
//      - Changed order that OnComboRollUp was fired with respect to when the combo
//        is hidden.  It is hidden first then OnRollUp is fired so any long processing
//        in OnRollUp does not leave an empty combo visible.
//      - Fixed design time issue with VirtualShellToolbars, changing Caption then
//        Name reset Caption to new Name
//  7.13.02
//      - Fixed menu to have correct colors in XP, also drawn a bit more "XP" like
//  7.13.02
//      - Upgraded and added Robert Lee's VirtualShellHistory component to the package.
//
// 7.05.02
//      - VirtualShellUtilites.pas:
//              Dymamiclly loaded SHGetDataFromIDListW for Win95 compatibility
//
//  07.04.02
//      - Fixed bug in ContextMenus when not using context menus.  Would not show
//        PopupMenu Property menu if clicked on item.  Simplified old old checks after
//        learning of result to WM_CONTEXTMENU for the VCL to stop propogation to assigned
//        context menu.
//      - Fixed bug in ContextMenus when using per node context menu handler and
//        also wanting ShellContextMenus.  The File column always overrides any user
//        menu and uses the ContextMenus if turned on.
//  07.02.02
//      - VirtualShellNewMenu: Added an "After File Create" event to allow the
//        new node to be selected for editing after it is created.
//      - Changed the logic in OnGetVETText.  It is now called for ALL columns so
//        any columns text can be modified.  The Text sent to the event is what
//        will appear in the column if it is unmodified
//      - Fixed designtime bug where TExplorerComoboBox would not show its name
//        in the control when first dropped on form
//
//  Version 1.8.230
//
//  06.30.02
//      - Updated to work with VT 3.3.2
//        This means that:
//              1) The AV with the column selection dialog is fixed and the
//              2) The problem with the Drag Image ghosting should be fixed
//      - ShellNotifyWatchFolder now takes an optional parameter ChangeReason that
//        allows the application to decide what will trigger a ShellNoify event
//      - Fixed bug with shell notify with 2 listviews in one app
//      - Fixed bug with the WaitCursor sticking the cursor to an hourglass with two VETs in one app
//      - Added Option to allow the Listview to not lock the backbrowsing to the rootfoler using
//        the keyboard or BrowseTo
//      - add Option, toNoRebuildIconListOnAssocChange, to stop icon rebuilding on
//        an Association change as XP has a side effect of changing the iconsize then
//        back again.  It reorganizes the desktop icons.
//      - Fixed AV in SetBackBrowseRoot property setter, added check for nil
//  05.20.02
//      - Themes would not disable in the Combobox, fixed
//      - Reworked the UI of the Combobox DropDown list to mimic the normal TCombobox DropDownList style for focus and selection
//      - Cached the InFolderName for speed reasons
//
//  04.26.02
//      - Finished up the Drag and Drop in the Toolbars.
//      - Changed the name of ShellUtilites to VirtualShellUtilites to be consistant
//
//  04.25.02
//      - Added two new options to deal with what happens to a Folder or Folder Shortcut
//        when it is doubleclicked and the ShellExecute code is called (if that
//        option is enabled, toExecuteOnDblClk)
//            toBrowseExecuteFolder,        // Substitues the default ShellExecute action (opens an explorer window) for a folder namespace to a VET navigation action
//            toBrowseExecuteFolderShortcut // Substitues the default ShellExecute action (opens an explorer window) for a shortcut to a folder namespace to a VET navigation action
//         $$ WARNING $$ These may need to be set in your application by hand. If
//            the tree will not expand then check these new options $$ WARNING OFF $$
//      - Fixed bug with the new ShellNotifyWatchFolder ShellNotify function and
//        WinNT 4.0 with a network.
//      - Removed the ReadOnly property in the ExplorerCombobox and replaced it
//        with a Style propery that more closely resembles TComboBox for DropDown styles
//      - Fixed the ComboBox TabStop property for all VSTools components!

//  04.23.02
//      - Fixed AV when deleting ExplorerCombobox from form
//      - Improved OnShellExectue event, new parameters
//      - Shortcuts of Folders now browse to the folder rather than opening an explorer window
//      - Added another level of Shell Change notifiers.  See the VirtualExplorer Demo and the
//        global function:
//           procedure ShellNotifyWatchFolder(WatchFolderPath: WideString; Control: TWinControl);
//        NOTE the control must already be registered with the shellnotifier thread
//           procedure RegisterShellNotifyControl(Control: TWinControl);
//           procedure UnRegisterShellNotifyControl(Control: TWinControl);
//
//
//  04.15.02
//      - Added intellegant filtering of ShellNotifications to the Listview. Only
//          passes notification if for the tree level that is displayed
//
//  04.14.02
//      - Milan's nagging memory leak with TVirtualExplorerCombobox is fixed!
//
//  04.13.02
//      - Reorginized the VSTools package, renamed units and components to be
//        consistant.
//      - Implemented a FindFirstChangeNotification thread to catch those pesky
//        file creates that sneak by the Shell Notification
//
//  04.12.02
//      - Fixed AV when ExplorerComboBox deleted at designtime.
//      - Restructured the heirarcy of TExplorerTreeviews and Listviews so they are
//        compatible with each other.  They both now derive from TVirtualExplorerViews
//        which  publishes all common properties between both components.
//
//  04.06.02
//      - Fixed bug in notification updates.  If node was collapsed and an update
//        occured in that folder the items were duplicated until a refresh occured
//      - All Virtual Namespace issues will be dealt with after VSTools 1.0 is released
//
//  04.06.02
//      - Added overloaded CreateNewFolder method that returns the new folders name
//        if successful.
//      - Implemented the Assign and AssignTo methods for VET
//              NOTE as of VT 3.1.8 there is a bug in its Assign (D4-D5 only) so these must not
//              be used until Mike fixes the bug.
//
//  04.03.02
//      - Fixed problem with network machine paths and the combobox in Path mode
//      - TExplorerListbox: added a BackBrowseRoot property.  It is initally set
//        to the designtime RootFolder and is used to compare when the user tries
//        to navigate up the tree with the keyboard (Backspace).  The BackBrowseRoot
//        clones the TNamespace that is used to set so simply set the back space
//        lock using any TNamespace object.
//      - Tree/List links make listview navigation respect the treeviews root folder
//
//  04.03.02
//      - Reworked the InternalCreateFolder to be Uniocde and fixed few bugs
//
// 03.23.02
//       - Changed logic in DragDrop so it is possible to set Effect to DROPEFFECT_NONE
//         in the event handler and cancel the drop
//
// 03.23.02
//      - SelectedFilesCut
//        SelectedFilesCopy
//        replaced with VT methods CopyToClipboard and CutToClipboard
//
// 03.19.02
//      - Fixed bug with context menu showing parent menu after showing context menu
//
// 03.10.02
//      - Fixed issues compiling with D4.  Finally done.  Unfortunately there are
//        a few issues with converting the OLE Drag Managers designtime forms to D4
//        as I took advantage of events in the TListview that are only available in
//        D5 and up.  The OLE Drag Managers are avaiable but they will have to be
//        created at runtime.
//
// 03.07.02
//      - Fixed bug in Dropdowns in Combobox.  AutoScrolls inop and VETEnhanced mode
//        did not work after last round with the dropdown focus issue
//      - Fixed bug where the AutoEdit after Folder create would cancel the edit
//        when the control recieved a ShellNotify for the new creation.
//
// 03.04.02
//      - Fixed Memory leak in the Tree Persistence classes.  Reworked a few list
//        classes (TPIDLList and TLeafNodeList) to take advantage of the newer
//        Streamable classes in VirtualShellUtilities.  Changed the Create parameters to none
//        and there is no longer FreeOnDestroy properties, it is now SharePIDLs and
//        ShareNodes to be more like TImageList.  If Share then the objects are not
//        freeded during a Clear or Destroy.
//      - Fixed problem in the Storage "GetCheckedPath" and "GetResolvedPath" when
//        a flopply is checked with no disk in the drive. It would throw dialog boxes
//        and the drive would not be returned in the path list.
//
// 03.02.02
//      - Fixed bug introduced by fixing another bug in ShellNotify thread.  Did not
//        reflect changes in a directory if the directory was empty. Fixed.
//      - Fixed issues with right clicking and clicking on no node in the drop
//        down windows.
//
// 03.01.02
//      - Stripped out the #$@% RichEdit and plugged in Troy Wolbrink's Unicode
//        TEdit, Thanks Troy.
//      - Removed the Combo MinEditHeight property, that is what Constraints are for!
//
// 02.27.02
//      - Reworked the painting of the Combobox. It now is fliker free without using
//        double buffering
//      - Had to shift Milan RichEdit alignment by 1 pixel
//
// 02.23.02
//      - Many more tweaks and inhancements in the dropdowns for the combobox.
//        They now mimic the IE and Explorer Dropdowns and are XP enabled
//      - Added more shortcuts present in Explorer to show context menus, Shift-F10 and ContextMenu Key
//      - Bug Fixes
//      - Changed implementation for Clipboard operations.  VT now has virtual methods
//        for CopyToClipboard, CutToClipboard and PasteFromClipboard so now use
//        these instead of SelectedFilesCopy and SelectedFilesCut.
//        SelectedFilePaste(MultipleTargets) is still avaiable for pasting into
//        several folders at once.
//        By doing this the standard Actions will automagiclly work with VET!
//
//
// 02.17.02
//      - Major renaming of ComboDrop down components to make it more consistent
//      - Added necessary hooks to create new customized decendants of the Dropdown
//        windows and the VET and VT contained within each.
//
// 02.16.02
//      - Too many changes to list in any detail
//      - TNamespace reworked and 30% smaller memory footprint per node
//          - This will effect anyone using the IExtractImage and IShellLink (shortcut)
//            interfaces.  These are now sub objects of TNamespace.
//      - Reworked the dropdowns on TExplorerCombobox. After MUCH work they are
//        fully XP theme aware and look like the ones in IE and Windows Explorer
//      - Bug fixes
//      - Added new event for RootNamespace rebuild
//      - Cleaned up the ShellUtilites.pas file and the VirtualExplorerTree.pas file so
//        they are in logical order and added more comments.
//      - Fixed right click of header caused resort of column before showing context menu
//      - Reworked the Column edit dialog for showing/Hiding columns on right click of header
//      - Found solution to drag image being left on screen after popup or dialog shown.
//        Mike is implementing it in next release of VT (after 3.0.4)
//      - Published a lot more properties from VT.  I am not sure of 100% compatiblilty with
//        VET but if not let me know and I will try to work it out.
//      - Fixed memory leak in shell notifictions after last reworking of Combobox Dropdowns.
//      - Fixed memory leak in Combobox auto complete
//      - Moved all WideString calls to a separate unit and wrote a few extras to deal with path names in Unicode
//      - Implemented all calls in VirtualExplorerTree and ShellUtilties to make exclusive use
//        of WideStrings. Only Three functions in ShellUtities are not Unicode and only
//        effect VET if NOT using the shell defined Columns.
//      - Changed to property name System in TNamespace to SystemFile due to confict
//        with the use of the System unit and the Copy function (Reported by Adem Babba, thanks)
//
// 01.19.02
//      - Eliminated the VETDropdownForm file and associated overhead of that method of making
//        a dropdown window
//      - Implemented dual speed Auto scrolling of combobox dropdown like Explorer,
//        just because Werner asked :^)
//      - Added AutoComplete to Edit of Combobox.  A few things are still not done
//         1) the autoscroll of the AutoComplete is not working
//         2) The selection rectangle is drawn in an inactive color
//         3) The autocomplete is not Unicode (waiting for Poll results)
//         4) Need to understand how it should work with the TExplorerComboBox (like explorer?)
//      - Rewrote the whole Combobox class breaking it up into sub-objects that expand in
//        the OI for easier usability.  No effort was made to make it a transparent upgrade,
//        you will get errors and loose property settings.
//
// 01.17.02
//      - Add the Current RootNamespace to the parameter list of OnRootChanging. *Note the order*
//      - Add Alt-Down Arrow to drop combo
//      - Combo browses to path if typed in even if it not connected to anything
//      - Dropdown animation respects system settings (SPI_GETCOMBOBOXANIMATION)
//      - Added SelectedNodesDelete, SelectedNodesCopy, SelectedNodesShowProperties, SelectedNodeCut and PasteFromClipboard methods to VET
//
// 01.16.02
//      - Bug fix in the Enumfolder method with OnEnumFolder defined and toHideRecycleBin
// 01.13.02
//      - Compatible with VT 3.0.4
//
// 01.10.02
//      - Reworked mouse handling of TExplorerCombo to be like Explorer
//      - Reworked the drawing of the combo dropdown button
//      - Changed defaults of combo properties to be like explorer
//      - Auto select path text in TExplorerCombo after node selection like explorer
//      - Bug fix: ExplorerComboBox text not selected when path typed in then browsed to
//      - Implemented code to allow special folders (at least at the desktop and
//        My Computer levels) to be typed in and browsed to in the ExplorerComboBox
//      - Combobox defaults to the desktop folder if not linked with other VET
//      - Implemented the sizing of the Edit box in ExplorerComboBox like the
//        TEdit control so they can stay the same size regardless of Font.
//      - Implemented a MinEditHeight property to override the above calculation
//      - Implemented an AlwaysExpandDrives property in ExplorerComboBox to mimic
//        explorer if desired
//      - Implemented an OnInvalidPath event in ExplorerComboBox that fires if the
//        user enters a path that can not be found. If not assigned a default
//        message is shown
//      - Disabled the annoying hourglass cursors in ExplorerComboBox on dropdown
//      - Fixed couple of memory leaks thanks to Milan Vandrovec
//
//
// 01.08.02
//      - Updated the UnicodeRichEdit again for Milan.  Only uses the custom draw
//        for BCB under Win9x and RichEd20.dll.
//      - Reworked the new custom draw code for the pushbutton on the combobox
//        now scales with the windows settings. Uses windows setting to calcualate
//        positions and dimenstions.
//
// 01.07.02
//      - Added Theme support for the ExplorerCombobox.  Removed the TSpeedbutton since
//        I have to custom draw the themed button anyway custom draw the regualar button
//      - Used system images and metrics to display the dropdown button
//      - Modification for BCB compatibility
//
// 01.06.02
//      - Fixed problem in VET Persistence class when tree rooted with custom
//        path or PIDL.
//      - Reimplement the streams so future changes will not break existing persistent
//        streams unfortunately streams created previous to this release will be broken.
//
// 01.05.02
//      - Fixed color issues with ExplorerCombobox.
//      - Fixed design time drawing of text and image in ExplorerComboBox
//      - Fixed issue with not allowing Desktop node to be without a checkbox
//      - Fixed small issue with TNodeStream Load and Save methods
//      - Fixed problem with ViewManager and duplicating TStorage trees causing file
//        to double with each save.
//      - Fixed issue with Storage.CheckedFileNames.  Was returning files that only
//        had the mixed checkbox so it was not a valid checked node.
//              The property as it stands now will return *all* nodes that are
//              valid files/directories and have a checkmark.  This means that it
//              is possible to return a directory and all subdirectories under it
//              if the parent directory is fully checked.  It is up to calling
//              program to filter out any folders that may be redunant for cases where
//              the parent node is expanded and checked, causing all its children to
//              be checked.
//
// 01.02.02
//      - Reworked the Shell Notifier thread.  Removed a lot of unnecessary overhead
//        and found a better implementation to drasticlly speed up the response of
//        VET to any shell response.  For small number of files the response is
//        instantanous yet for large number files this does not have negative effects on
//        the thread and it is still significantly faster then before.
//      - Added special case handling of UpdateDir notify events to rebuild the tree.
//        XP is very lazy (Win2k less so) about sending detailed events (even if we
//        explicitly send a CreateItem notification to the shell it still only generates
//        a UpdateDir for the Desktop)
//      - Fixed problem with user defined menus popping up after the context menu
//        closed.
//      - Fixed logic error in Notification causing VET to miss some file change events
//      - Fixed memory leak when "Hide root folder" option was used
//      - Fixed AV issue with RichEdit in ExplorerComboBox and BCB debugger
//
//                               Version 1.7.6
//        COMPILE COMPATIBLE WITH VIRTUALTREEVIEW 2.7.5 AN UP ONLY
//
//  12.28.01
//      - Fixed the UnicodeRichText for the ExplorerCombobox.  Win9x with       }
//        RichEdit 2.0 or greater (unicode aware richedit) was done incorrectly }
//      - Bug fixes.
//      - Reworked FreeNode to be faster
//      - If a Folder node is selected then deleted the focus moves to the deleted
//        nodes parent. (Forces a change event to keep linked compoents from displaying
//        the contents of a delete node, plus it is how Explorer works)
//      - "Spiced up" the TExplorerCombobox. It now supports:
//              - Background colors
//              - Background images
//              - Added a defineable "grabbable" border around the dropdown so it
//                  is easier to grab
//              - Added option to show full path or just the file name
//      - Fixed issue with the new ChangeNotification system.  It is highly
//        possible that the ChangeNotifier event can be called reentrantly
//        depending on how the components are connected together.  Added flags to let
//        the VET components keep track of when they are processing a change notification
//        and to ignore notifications that are fired due to something done from
//        within that notification cycle.
//      - Added parameter to OnRootChanging to actually make it a useful event
//
//  12.26.01
//      - Reworked the Combobox edit.  When typing in the path the feedback was
//        strange compared to Explorer
//      - Could not copy the text in the ComboEdit, pressing Ctrl erased text! Fixed
//      - Added intellegece to the ComboEdit.  If an invalid path is entered the
//        Combo will walk the entered path and hilight the path from the point that
//        it becomes invalid to the end to help show where the error occured.
//      - Added F4 hot key to force dropdown
//      - Fixed typo in ExplorerComboBox. Sizable property is now Sizeable.
//
//                               Version 1.7.5
//        COMPILE COMPATIBLE WITH VIRTUALTREEVIEW 2.7.5 AN UP ONLY
//
//  12.21.01
//      - Added work around for a small problem with VT's AutoTriStateTracking by
//        adding the ctTriStateCheckBox check type to the node immediatly after adding
//        it to the tree if toCheckSupport is enabled.
//      - Finished up details of Checkbox support (Setting checks by passing
//        file names)
//      - Minor changes to Combobox edit to mimic Explorer more closely
//      - Bug fixes in the DropDownForm
//
//  12.18.01
//      - Reworked all the threads.  It turns out I was abusing the Event Objects.
//        Since I did not want to be branded an Event abuser I now track if the event
//        is signaled or not and only call ResetEvent or SetEvent if it is not already
//        in the desired state.  By setting and resetting events over and over unnecessarily
//        the event becomes unpredictable in triggering a WaitForSingleObject function.
//        The threads are now much more predictable and don't miss events/images filling
//      - Fixed self triggering ShellNotifications if the hidden recycle folders
//        accross multiple drives where expanded.  Reading the folders fires Notify
//        Events which cause VET to reread the folder which caused more firing of
//        Notify Events.  The hidden Recycle folders will not auto update if
//        their contents change without a manual refresh.  The normal RecycleBin will
//        work as expected and auto-update.  It is not the best solution but I do
//        not know how to detect the recycle folders with high confidence (the folders
//        are renameable)
//
//  12.15.01
//      - Checkbox persistence is finally working as it should.
//
//  12.14.01
//      - Added a global ViewManager object so an application with muliple VETs can
//        take on the views of other VETs without those needing to be created to get
//        at their ViewObject property.  It also allows all VETs to be saved in one file.
//      - Bug fixes: Obviously *NOBODY* is using Views since a few versions ago it was totally broken <g>
//
//  12.12.01
//      - Reworked Inter-Component linking.  Now works on by global VETChangeDispatch
//        object.  This object manages IVETChangeLink interface objects.  Any thing
//        can be a client of or server to TVirtualExplorerTree, TExplorerListview, TExplorerTreeview,
//        or TExplorerCombobox.
//        CLIENTS:
//        Simply define a client class and add a TVETChangeNotifyEvent
//        method in it.  Register the client with the desired VirtualControl with
//        VETChangeDispatch.RegisterChangeLink passing the Source (VirtualControl),
//        Client (the object wanting to be notified of the VirtualControl changes),
//        the address of the method to call in the Client object when a change
//        occurs, and a method to call when any IVETChangeLink object is being destroyed.
//        If the Client object is destroyed or if the link is to be broken
//        call VETChangeDispatch.UnRegisterChangeLink using one of the following flags:
//        utServer,       // ONLY USED FOR SERVER OBJECTS: Breaks links of a server object with clients
//        utClient,       // Breaks Changes links of a particualr Client from all Server object, only Client parameter used
//        utLink,         // Breaks a particular link between a Client and a Server, both Client and Server paramaters must be used.
//        utAll           // ONLY USED FOR SERVER OBJECTS: Breaks all links of a
//                        // single object regardless, Client and Server parameters should point to same object
//        SERVER:
//        To create a server to a VET component call TChangeDispatch.RegisterChangeLink
//        with a Server object and the VET component as the client.  The ClientOnChangeEvent must be the
//        VET's ChangeLinkChanging method and the OnFreeing method should be the
//        VET's ChangeLinkFreeing method.  Then in your server object call
//        VETChangeDispatch.DispatchChange with the new PIDL the VET control should BrowseTo.
//        This architecture allows any number of VirtualControls to be synced together and in any order
//
//  12.08.01
//      - Fixed bug introduced with VT 2.7.3 with setting parent node selected when
//        the current selected node is within a collapsing a branch
//      - Updated the TExplorerCombobox.  It now an editable Unicode aware control
//      - Added options to allow TExplorerCombobox to be ReadOnly

//
//  11.19.01
//      - Fixed bug with file type association notification if registry key does not exist.
//      - Reinsterted some code removed yesterday. VT is not quite fixed in the
//        uninitialized children checking area.
//      - If no node is selected in TExplorerListview then ctl-v paste should paste
//        into that folder...  Fixed
//      - Fixed bug in PIDLSearchForInsertPt.  If first or last node were checked,
//        unchecked, then checked again the search would not find the insert point.
//      - Fixed bug in TStorageRoot.SelectedPaths. Did not retrieve paths of nodes
//        that had not been initialized.  Force initialization of all nodes first.
//      - Reworked the IShellLink class to be more efficent and less mistake prone
//
//  11.18.01
//      - Fixed bug with ShellColumns and VETColumns in base VET.
//      - Removed some code that corrected bugs in VT that were corrected in VT 2.6.11
//      - VET now will respond to icon changes during an file type association change
//
//
//                      Version 2.6.7
//
//  11.15.01
//      - Any class with ReadFromStream/File and WriteToStream/File were changed to
//        be more "Delphi" like with LoadFromStream/File SaveToStream/File
//      - ViewManger replaced Get and Set methods with corresponding properties with
//        these methods as the getters and settter.  I don't know why this was not
//        done in the first place.
//      - Made sure everything is WideStrings where applicable.
//      - Added a new OnRootChanging event, with an "Allowed" boolean
//      - In TExplorerListview only (for now) column widths, position and visibilty
//        are saved on a per node basis (like explorer) TreeOption.VETMiscOption
//        toPersistentColumn.
//      - Add event to allow user columns in ShellColumn mode, OnAddCustomShellColumn.
//      - Fixed bug and published OnCustomColumnCompare
//      - Added new simpler demos
//      - Included TShellLink component that encapsulates reading and writing of
//        ShellLink (*.lnk) shortcut files.
//
//  11.13.01
//      - Fixed bug with restoring of selectetd nodes during refresh or using
//        views
//      - Checkbox persistence implemented.
//      - Published the Incremental search properties
//      - Drag Drop default is now False
//
//  11.12.01
//      - Fixed bug with ShellNotifications.  VET did not respect OnEnumFolder
//        filtering when responding to shell changes.
//      - Implemented a more robust way of finding the "unknown" association icon
//        and the closed folder icon.
//      - First integration of the NodeStorage Classes.  These will make checkboxes,
//        column widths, and NodeData persistent.
//
//  11.09.01
//      - More issues with ExplorerComboBox fixed
//           - did not work right with ExplorerListview
//      - BrowseTo and BrowseToByPIDL is not work in ExplorerListview
//
//
//                      VERSION 1.6.7
//
//  11.08.01
//      - Changed the Attributes shell notify event to detect changes on network machine
//        printers changes.
//
//  11.07.01
//      - Fixed column editor locking the owner VET from updating screen.
//      - Anchored the "Live Update" checkbox in the column editor correctly.
//      - Added an OnRootChange event.  Called when the root shell folder of VET changes
//
//                              VERSION 1.6.6
//         *************   Required VT 2.6.5 to compile *********************
//
//  11.06.01
//      - Bug Fix with InternalWalkNodeToPIDL AV if control not active and Shell
//        notification were active.
//      - Fixed compatibility issuse for BCB
//      - Fixed DropDownCount property in TExplorerComboBox
//      - Added DefaultNodeHeight property to TExplorerComboBox
//
//  11.04.01
//      - Fixed - "Mutual Exclusive" assertion if right clicking is done just right
//      - Fixed - Right click draws lots of rectangles.
//      - Fixed - Rename is selected from contextmenu edit cancels if mouse moves in window
//      - Added Ctrl+Shift+A to invert selection
//      - Added Alt+Enter & Alt+DblClick to execute Property Dialog
//

//  10.28.01
//      - Fixed small bug in TExplorerComboBox when selecting the Desktop folder
//        or if the VET attached to the ComboBox had selected the Desktop then
//        opened the Combobox.
//      - TExplorerComboBox now works like Explorer as "My Computer" is always expanded
//
//                          Version 2.6.5
//      ***** THIS WILL NOT COMPILE WITH THE VET DEMO PROGRAM ******
//
//  10.28.01
//      - Added TExplorerComboBox.  It is UNICODE aware although you can not type in
//        the editbar yet.
//
//  10.27.01
//      - TExplorerListview: New Backspace key now syncs TExplorerTreeview
//      - TExplorerListview/TExplorerTreeview syncing problem when TExplorerTreeview
//          collapsed... Fixed
//      - Removed the code in BrowseToByPIDL that forced the selected node to the
//        top node postion.  VT will do that if necessay when Selected := True
//      - TExplorerListview now responds to Enter by going into selected folder if
//        it is a folder or executing the file if it is a file, or more precisely
//        Enter = Mouse Left Button Double Click
//      - TExplorerTreeview ShowRoot now defaults to false to mimic Explorer
//      - Added node Focus settings when VET is resets it RootFolder
//
//  10.23.01
//      - Allowed TExplorerListview to be selected by clicking the icon as well as the text.
//      - In TExplorerListview BackSpace backs up one level of folders.
//      - More improvements and bug fixes in TExplorerListview
//
//  10.22.01
//      - Fixed incorrect usage of internal IShellDetail usage
//      - Overrode VT options to not allow toAutoSort, which cause infinate recursion
//        and is not used in VET, and force the single level selection if toMultiSelect
//        is set.
//      - Fixed incorrect logic in the implemention of the toShellColumnDetails option
//        so it did not conflict or be corrupted by the basic VET Column Options
//      - Fixed "No Handle" problem when dropping a TExplorerListview on the form
//
//  10.21.01
//      - Fixed files from having "+" buttons when VET FileObjects did not include
//        foFolders.  (WinME shows the "+" for the built in Zip file utilites)
//
//                    Version 2.6.1
//  10.21.01
//      - Residual problems with all the changes to toShellColumnDetails. AV's in
//        the demo and during design time.  More checks, fixed.
//
//                    Version 2.6.0
//      **** MUST USE WITH VT VERSION 2.5.43 OR GREATER ***************
//
// 10.20.01
//      - Applied my new found expertise <g> in sorting theory to the TVETPersistent
//        class.  In a test case with a folder with 7000 files in it, all of which
//        were selected (that was the weak point of this class restoring the selection
//        of nodes)
//           VET 1.5.40 - 12:00 MINUTES
//           VET 2.6.0  - 3.5 SECONDS Whoo-Hoo!
// 10.19.01
//      - Cleaned up the VET file.
//      - Implemented the "Right click on the header to change/show/hide columns"
//        like Explorer
//      - The data in toShellColumnDetails mode is not cached so it is a bit sluggish
//        but the columns will have titles based on the local and special folder
//        columns are now supported.  This option really has no real use unless you
//        are implementing an Explorer Listview clone.  TVirtualExplorerListview
//        automaticlly supports it.
//      - Moved all strings into VETResources.pas to allow easier language translations
//
// 10.17.01
//      - Expanded the toShellColumnDetails option to allow the TVirtualExplorerListview
//        to emulate the number of headers and header titles like Explorer.  This
//        includes some more work on the IShellFolder2 interface.  It is not fully
//        implemented yet but the next round of improvement should finish it up.
//      - PROBLEM: If using threaded images and the first folder expanded is MyDocuments
//        the MyPictures folder image is wrong, same in ME and Win2k....
//        SOLUTION:  Reworked Image thread.  Found a property that was calling a non
//        threadsafe object dealing with the PIDLs.  All code dealing with threaded
//        image extraction is now internal to the Image Thread. Likely the cause of rare
//        mystery AV's in the PIDLMgr object though. Image extraction seems faster but
//        could just be an illusion.
//
// 10.15.01
//      - Moved the ThreadNotifyThread and associated classes to ShellUtilities.
//        This move allows other components to use the Thread, such as the
//        TShellToolbar, and TDriveToolbar. Reworked the registration and
//        creation/deletion aspects of it.  Now to register a window (not just a VET)
//        with it use the new global function in Shell Utilities:
//           procedure RegisterShellNotifyControl(Control: TWinControl);
//           procedure UnRegisterShellNotifyControl(Control: TWinControl);
//        then respond to the WM_SHELLNOTIFY message.
//
//  10.14.01
//      - Completely reworked the ShellNotificiation Thread.  It is *MUCH* faster
//        and *MUCH* more professional looking as VET is updated by changes in the
//        shell.  The update is several orders of magnitude faster, no exageration,
//        and does not effect node selection in the target folder.  It works very
//        similar to Explorer now.
//      - Along with the above a more sophisticated ShellNotify event is available.
//        it does not catch all file activity but the folder that the activity can be
//        found along with media changes, drive mapping/unmapping etc.
//      - The ShellNotifyThread now is completely dead if the VET options are set
//        to not use it.
//      - VET now detects and refreshes the details, such as Attributes, if they
//        are changed.
//      - When selecting mulitple objects and their context menu is shown the
//        tree unselects all but the node that the mouse was over.  This is due
//        to the toRightButtonSelect option but this also must be set to right
//        drag.  Not sure how to fix it.  ... FIXED ...
//      - Reworked the sort routine.  It still assumed a fixed order for column contents
//        from a number of versions ago.
//      - Added an event to handle Sorting of Custom Columns
//      - Sorting now detects toShellColumnDetails and uses the Shell to sort the
//        columns if possible.
//      - Fixed AV problem the first time the TExplorerListview was clicked if it
//        was connected to a TExplorerTreeview
//
//
//  10.06.01
//      - In Win2k the drag images where doubled
//      - Win2k drag image did not track mouse button down correctly
//      - Started reworking the ShellNotifyThread
//
//  10.04.01
//      - Found another issue with ShellNotifyThread if more than 1 VET was
//        registered. Caused invalid pointer AV.
//
//
//                      VERSION 1.5.40
//           VERSION 1.3.40 OF VET REQURES VT 2.5.40 TO COMPILE
//
//  10.01.01
//      - Removed the toDragImage in VETMiscOptions.  VT now contains the necessary
//        hooks to allow VET to handle the IxxxxHelper objects using only the
//        DragImageKind property.  No streaming support was added for this transition
//        so it will generate an error in the IDE when it can't read this flag,
//        ignore it.
//
//  9.30.01
//      - Fixed thread race condition in the ShellNotifyThread
//
//  9.29.01
//      - Added VirtualExplorerTree property to automaticlly sync two
//        ExplorerTrees. To expand this capablility a new VET option was added:
//        VETSyncOptions which allows some flexability in how the target VET acts
//        when it is syncronized with the source VET.
//              toCollapseTargetFirst,      // Collapse all expanded node before selecting target node
//              toSelectTarget              // Select the node in the syncronized Target VET
//      - Created two VET decendants that that simplify the creation of an Explorer
//        style Treeview and Listview.
//
//  9.14.01
//      - Added support for Large Images
//
//                      VERSION 1.5.31
//  9.13.01
//      - property OnDrawHeader has become property OnHeaderDraw in VT
//      - Added support for user defined ContextMenu in white area of VET
//      - Published a number of snazzy XP control lookalike options
//      - Published OnDragAllowed, OnDragOver, OnDragDrop it is highly recommended
//        that the parameters be left alone.
//
//                      VERSION 1.5.28
//      REQUIRED VT 2.5.28 OR GREATER
// 9.9.01
//      - Updated to compile with VT 2.5.28
//      - Rework Options.  Made a decentant of VT options.
//      - Added automatic conversion of previous properties
//      - Removed upgrade support for old UseXXXXX option properties
//      - Moved the version history to a separate file, History.txt
//      - Published OnChecked and OnChecking
//
// 9.8.01
//      - Added FindNode and FindNodeByPIDL to search for the node that is represented
//        by the PathName or the PIDL.  WARNING: This only succeds if the node has
//        been initialized!  It does not try to force anything to search for the
//        node.
//
//                      VERSION 1.5.20
// 8.26.01
//      - With HideRootFolder you could not drop files it that folder
//      - Shell Notifier thread did not work for HideRootFolder
//      - If shell wanted to copy a file during D&D it VET alway moved it.
//        Apparently this has been broken since 1.4.23!!!!!!!!!
//      - Implemented a reference counting system for showing the wait cursor
//      - Added two new options:
//              vetoForceHideRecycleBin:   Never show the RecycleBin
//              vetoForceShowMyDocuments   Always show the My Documents folder
//                                         even if user has removed it from desktop

//                      VERSION 1.5.13
//  8.2.01
//      - Fixed a few bugs in the HideRootFolder option
//  7.31.01
//      - Updated to work with VT 2.5.13
//
//                      VERSION 1.5.9
//  7.16.01
//  ************************************************************************
//  THIS VERSION OF VET REQUIRES THE MATCHING MINOR VERSION OF VT - 2.5.9
//  ************************************************************************
//      - Updated the VET to work with the new TreeOptions.
//             - WARNING:
//                 It is now possible to select options that will cause VET
//                 problems.
//                 The biggest one is toLevelSelectConstraint MUST be set to
//                      true if using multiple select.  Some day I will try to
//                      allow this but for now it will throw an error if the
//                      tree is manipulated with children that are not immediate
//                      decendants of a parent node.
//
//                      VERSION 1.5.8
//  7.12.01
//      - Split VET from the VT package
//      - Added ShellHints option.  Use the hints option to show hints
//        associated with file (Win98, WinMe, Win2k only)
//      - Moved the following Properties in to a VETOptions set property:
//              - UseChangeNotifierThread
//              - UseContextMenus
//              - UseDragDrop
//              - ExecuteOnDblClk
//              - FoldersExpandable
//              - HideRootFolder
//              - UseImages
//              - UseShellColumnDetails
//              - UseThreadedImages
//        Defined read methods for the old properties in DefineProperties
//        so the upgrade should be transparent to existing users.
//
//                      VERSION 1.5.7
//  ************************************************************************
//  THIS VERSION OF VET REQUIRES THE MATCHING MINOR VERSION OF VT - 2.5.7
//  ************************************************************************
//
//  7.07.01
//      - Made SelectedToPIDLArray and SelectedToNamespaceArray functions public
//      - Fixed bug in test to see if "+" should be display (incorrect for Folder only view)
//      - Published OnPaintText property
//
//                      VERSION 1.5.1
//
// 7.02.01
//      - Enough changes to increment the minor version number.
//      - Auto Edit Select for CreateNewFolder broken with last VT release - fixed.
//
// 7.01.01
//      - Implemented the Columns using the new mechinism in VT which allows
//        decendants of TVirtualColumn to be created.  Because of this Header is
//        now published and it is possible to manipulate the Column Details in the
//        the Object Inspector!!!!!!
//          - EFFECTS TO CURRENT VET USERS
//              1) The VET Column Colors properties under VETColors is gone, it
//                 can be done through the Header property like VT.
//              2) The VisibleColumns property is gone.  Use the Column Editor
//                 through the Header Property to create new columns and assign
//                 what detail required through the ColumnDetails property in
//                 each column.
//              3) Custom Columns are a bit different. The ONLY time OnGetVETText
//                 is called is if the ColumnDetails is set to cdCustom.  To do
//                 this at runtime you will have to cast the TVirtualColumn to
//                 a TVETColumn:
//                 (VirtualExplorerTree.Header.Columns[0] as TVETColumn).ColumnDetails := cdCustom;
//
//                 As a result of this the Handled parameter has been removed so
//                 it is necessary to change the Event declaration.
//      - Updated the Demo to reflect the new changes to the Columns.
//
// 6.26.01
//      - Fixed another bug with Views and HideRootNode mode, WalkPIDLToNode
//        should not return the RootNode
//      - Published NodeDataSize so apps can attach custom data to a node.
//
//                      VERSION 1.4.35
// 6.26.01
//      - Fixed bug in ChangeNotification thread, not responding to UpdateDir
//      - Added access to selected nodes:
//              SelectedPath - Path of the currently selected node
//              SelectedPaths - Paths of all currently selected nodes
//              SelectedFile - Filename of the currently selected node
//              SelectedFiles - FileNames of all currently selected nodes
//      - Changed "Listview" mode to "HideRootFolder" to make it reflect what it does
//      - Fixed AV if in HideRootFolder mode if the RootFolder that is requested
//        can not be created because the SpecialFolder does not exist or the Path is invalid.
//
//
//                      VERSION 1.4.34
//  ************************************************************************
//  THIS VERSION OF VET REQUIRES THE MATCHING MINOR VERSION OF VT 2.4.34
//  ************************************************************************
// 6.21.01
//      - By popular request added "Listview" mode. The single root folder is not
//        shown in this mode.
//
// 6.19.01
//      - Added support for IDragSourceHelper.  If under Win2k the drag image
//        will be shown over any drop target that supports IDragTargetHelper.
//        This includes the Desktop IE and Windows Explorer.
//
// 6.18.01
//      - Bug Fix Possible to send invalid values to IContextMenu.GetCommandString
//        added additional checks. More RangeCheck errors fixed.
//      - Implemented faster FullCollapse based on how VET expandes nodes.
//      - Hooked '/' collapse all key to use my new FullCollapse method.
//      - Finished porting over OLE stuff to VT 2.4.28, waiting for next version of VT
//        to add a few items that were overlooked to complete conversion.
//
// 6.17.01
//      - Bug Fix - logic errors at design time between Active and RootFolder.
//
// 6.16.01
//      - Implemented my own FullCollapse method.
//
// 6.11.01
//      - Fixed a number of range check errors in the MenuMessages.
//
// 6.08.01
//      - Added another method to create new folders that is more generic
//        CreateNewFolderByNode.  Pass a node and a new folder will be created
//        in it, the node must be a folder itself.
//
//                     VERSION 1.4.24
// 6.06.01
//      - Added a CreateNewFolder method. Pass the target folder where a new folder
//        will be created in.  The passed folder MUST exist.  It will act just like
//        Explorer creating a new folder named "New Folder" or "New Folder (x)".
//      - Reworked the context menu/ right click again.  Now the Right mouse button
//        works just like Explorer with right dragging popping up a context menu to
//        verify the operation or choose a different operation.
//
// 6.05.01
//      - Fixed bug in NotifyThread for syncronization of threads.
//      - Fixed bug calling Free instead of Release in a referenced counted object!
//      - Work around for confirmation dialog popuping up when drag + shift to copy a
//        file.  The Shell does not like VT's calling of DragOver from within the
//        DragDrop method. Added Dragging flag so DragOver does not call the shells
//        IDropTarget interfaces during this call to DragOver, the inherited DragOver
//        is still called to preserve whatever VT was trying to do.
//
//                     VERSION 1.4.23
//
// 6.04.01
//      - Reworked the Right Click Context Menu code to work just like Explorer.
//
//                     VERSION 1.4.22
//
// 6.03.01
//      - Reworked the Right Click Context Menu code to work a bit more like
//        Explorer.
//
//                     VERSION 1.4.21
//
// 6.03.01
//      - Added Column Color options under VETColors as to allow VET to look like
//        WindowsXP (or so I am told <g>).
//      - Updated Demo to show the new Color properties.
//      - Reworked the threaded images a bit.  If the file is a Folder and part
//        of the File System then the default image is the Folder image and not
//        the default Windows image.  It looks better.
//
//                     VERSION 1.4.20
//
// 6.02.01
//      - Changes necessary to work with VT version 2.4.20
//
//                     VERSION 1.1.18
// 6.01.01
//      - Added two new events to add extra functionality to Context Menus.
//           property OnContextMenuItemChange;
//           property OnContextMenuShow;
//      - OnContextMenuItemChange is called when the items in the context menu
//        are hilighted during the time the menu is open.
//      - OnContextMenuShow is called just before the menu is shown.  It is filled
//        with items and it is possible to modify it at this time.  Items can be
//        disabled (I would not recommed removing them) and new items added.  This
//        will allow new ContextMenu items to be added WITHOUT creating ContextMenu
//        handlers!!!!!
//
//                     VERSION 1.1.17
//  5.25.01
//      Image thread is now FINALLY thread safe!!!! :^)  Added a PeekMessage in
//      during the DoFreeNode to flush out the message queue of SetIconIndex
//      messages before allowing a node free itself.  This way a pending message
//      will not try to access a node that was just freed.  I can't make it crash
//      anymore!!!
//
//                     VERSION 1.1.16
//  5.20.01
//      - Updated VETPersistent to choose if the tree stores and restores the
//        currenly selected nodes.  For large directorys with thousands of selected
//        nodes being destroyed this became too time consuming.  After all it is
//        redundant to save selected nodes if those nodes are being deleted or moved.
//      - Reworked the ShellNotify thread.  Moved the delete timer into the thread and
//        out of the VET.  Instead of sending a message for each file deleted it now
//        simply updates the parent folders.  The thread queues the notifications and
//        ignores duplicates.  The time between when the thread sends a TMessage to
//        the VET's is definable through the ShellNotifyRefreshRate property the
//        global TNotifyEventThread class.  Default is 250ms.  This change made a
//        drastic difference on shell file manipulation speed when manipulating a
//        large number of files.
//
//  5.14.01
//      - Added an Active property to disable VET during design time mainly.
//      - Added OnGetVETText to hook into the column text so more columns can be
//        added or the existing ones overridden.
//
//  5.12.01
//      - Added a RefreshNode method to refresh a node after a change in the
//        enumeration filters for example.
//
//
//                     VERSION 1.1.7
//  5.11.01
//      - Reworked the entire Shell Notification system.  Decided too many PIDLs
//        and objects were being created.  Also if more than one VET was in the
//        application weird things happened.  Created global thread that VET's
//        register themselves with.  The objects passed to each VET are reference
//        counted (not COM my own implementation) so only one object for each
//        notificiation is now created and shared between the VETs.  One concequence
//        of this is that this is not thread safe. The VETs temporaraly modify the
//        PIDLs as they are processing the notification. The notifications MUST be handled
//        within the context of the main thread and all VETs must be in the same thread.
//        It is probably not an issue since the VCL is not thread safe anyway.
//      - Removed static linking to external functions so Mathias Thorell can use
//        VET in BCB5.  They are now dynamiclly linked in the initilization sections.
//      - Reworked the icon thread to be completely (ha) thread safe.
//
//                     VERSION 1.1.2
//  5.6.01
//      - Made the Icon Thread more thread safe with critical sections. Ran into
//        problems with more than 1 VET in a project, so up till now just lucky.
//      - If the tree is rooted off a custom or special folder the Shell Notification
//        thread did not work. Fixed.
//
//                      VERSION 1.1.1
//  5.6.01
//      - Moved all the VET color properties into a separate class.
//      - Fixed bug with Compressed folder color.
//      - Changed the version numbering to be consistant with VT
//
//                      VERSION 1.1
//  5.5.01
//      - Implemented MultiSelect.  It is slightly limited by the fact the Shell
//        can only handle a folder and it immediate children in drag/drop operations.
//        So VET forces the tree to have the voSiblingSelectConstraint in the options
//        property for now.  There are some possibilites that need to be explored
//        so this limitation may be eliminated in the future.
//      - Implemented Short-Cut keys for Delete <Del>, Copy <Ctrl + 'C'>,
//        Paste <Ctrl + 'V'>, and Cut <Ctrl + 'X'>.
//
//                      VERSION 1.0b
//  5.4.01
//      - Finally think the refreshing of the tree after a file delete/
//        create is fixed and is working right in Win98, Win2k, and WinNT
//
//                      VERSION 1.0a
// 4.29.01
//      - Implemented Ctrl + Left Click on a column header to toggle between
//        Autofit with and its previous width.
//      - Implemented Shift + Left Click on a column header to toggle between
//        minimum width and its previous width.
//      - Bug fix in Created and Accessed Time (oversight when coverting to
//        WideStrings)
//      - Implemented column click sorting in report view.
//      - "Fixed" refreshing of Recycle Bin by forcing a refresh of entire tree
//         the notification PIDL is not valid.  :^(
//      - Fixed bug when desktop item was created or renamed if c drive node is
//        initialized but not expanded the refresh would expand as far as it
//        could since VET also get a refresh for the physical desktop folder
//      - Added FolderTextColor and FileTextColor properties to try to make folders
//        and files visually different to help accent the distinction between them.
//
//                      VERSION 1.0
//
// 4.28.01
//      - Bug Fixes
//         : Saving VET to the stream did not save if the folder was expanded or
//           not. It now stores this info.
//         : Context menu actions were not being executed due to inverted logic
//         : Implemented DoInitChildren so "*" would expand all subfolders correctly
//         : Found a few memory leaks using MemProof thanks Atanas Stoyanov
//           <www.totalqa.com> and it is FREE!
//      - Implemented a Context menu event.  The verb is passed along with the
//        chance to handle the action and not allow it to be passed on to the
//        namespace to be executed by the shell.
//      - Added property to choose file sizes shown in Explorer (KB) style or
//        actual size.
//      - Added F5 to refresh tree
//
// 4.27.01
//      - Implemented a thread to monitor changes in the Shell using the
//        undocumented SHChangeNotifyRegister function.  Tried various implementation
//        ideas and finally settled on monitoring all deletion notifications.  In
//        order to speed up the task on large file manipulations BeginUpdate is
//        called on the first deletion of a node.  A timer is then started and
//        and it calls EndUpdate some time later.  This allows the notification
//        thread and the main thread to continue to call DeleteNode but with greatly
//        increased speed since the display is not updated for every node.  It is not
//        as fast as explorer but I will see how this works before changing the
//        individual deletes into a single UpdateParentDirectory.  The way it is done
//        has a better feel when taking a few files from a folder that contains thousands
//        of files.  The other way would have to ReEnumerate the folder which "feels"
//        slower.  User feedback will dictate which way this goes.
//
// 4.21.01
//      - Implemented TVETPersistent to store and restore the state of VET.
//
//      - Worked on documenting methods in TNamespace.
//
//      - Implemented TVETPersistent, a class to to store the state of a VET.
//      It can store the view state of the VET to a memory stream or to disk to
//      allow the tree to be restored to the state it was in before, as long
//      as the folders that were expanded are avaiable.  It expanded into
//      these branches as far as possible before giving up.
//
//      - Implemented a TView, TViewManager, and TViewList class to store "Views"
//      of VET.  These are simply a collection of TVETPersistent objects that can
//      be quickly switched between.
//
// 4.20.01
//      - Implemented FoldersExpandable property to be able to show folders but
//      not allow the user to expand the folder
//
//      - Moved Header to public so the columns can be manipulated programaticlly
//      This will be implemented in the Object Inspector at a later date.
//
//      - Updated ShowContextMenu to include "Rename". As a result VirtualExplorerTree
//      is called just after the context menu is closed with the chosen verb as a
//      parameter.  It is possible at this point to handle the users selection or
//      allow IContextMenu.ExecuteCommand to handle it.  Thanks to Giannakopulos
//      Kostas for clearing me up on a few issues.
//
//      - Redesigned the demo to not look so cluttered.
//
//      - Namespace names are now editable through VT's standard UI.
//
// 4.19.01:
//      - Added an OnEnumFilter event that is fired during the enumeration of the
//      folder. From this event the program can filter on name, type of folder,
//      or any other criteria that is avialable in a TNamespace class. Thanks to
//      Mathias Thorell for this idea. Updated Demo to show this feature.
//
//      - Began work on the notification thread that moniters the system for
//      changes that need to be reflected in VET.  From past experience it is
//      necessry to filter these to the minimum number necessray when a large
//      number of files are being manipulated or performance suffers greatly.
//
//      - Began work on implementing the IShellFolder2 interface.  Thanks to
//      Kostas Yannakopoulos for his Explorer Treeview component which contains
//      the conversion from C to Delphi for this interface and for other various
//      nuggets to make VET better.
//
//      - Made change to code to compile under D4.  IShellFolder function parameters
//      defined incorrecty in D4 need type casting to pointer.
//
//      - Added support for "rooting" the tree off of special folder available
//      through SHGetSpecialFolderLocation or allow a custom pathname to be used
//      using the RootFolder and RootFolderCustomPath properties



VIRTUALSHELLUTILITIES.PAS CHANGES

//
//                      VERSION 2.5.40
// 10.3.01
//      - Fixed bug in ExecuteContextMenuVerb it did not handle multiple items
//      - Reworked ExecuteContextMenuVerb to make it try to find the actual menu
//        item that corresponds to the verb.  That what the resource ID can be
//        sent rather than the verb string.  This is important for some namespace
//        items as they can be picky and not respond to the string verb.
//
//
//                      VERSION 2.5.16
// 8.18.01
//      - Bug fix. Memory leak due to not freeing some global TNamespace Objects
//        when unit unloaded
//      - Brought version up to match VET.
//
// 7.08.01
//      - Added a AdvDetailsSupported property to test if namespace can render
//        information about its column details through IShellFolder2 or IShellDetails
//
//                      VERSION 1.4.35
// 7.02.01
//      - Fixed incorrect WideString to PChar casts
//
//                      VERSION 1.4.34
// 6.20.01
//      - Fixed bug in multiple object Properties
//
// 6.11.01
//      - Fixed range check error in DirExists
//
// 6.08.01
//      - Fixed bug in ValidDetailsIndex.
//
//                      VERSION 1.4.22
// 6.06.01
//      - Fixed bug in ShowPropertySheet
//      - Reworked most methods that can use multiple namespaces as parameters to
//        be consistant.  This may break some code and I am sorry but I did not
//        realize how inconsistant it was.  To call methods that take multiple
//        namespaces the passed namespaces MUST BE immediate CHILDREN of the namespace
//        used to call the method. This means for instance to use the Delete method
//        to delete a namespace you use the Parent propery of that namespace to
//        call the Delete method with the child namespace to delete.  To only act on
//        one namespace you may call the method of the namespace to be acted on.
//
//
//  6.02.01
//      - Reworked ShellDetailInteface property getter. Added nil checks and removed
//        code to use the IShellFolder.GetUIObjectOf to retrieve interface.
//      - Fixed DetailsOf() method. Returned information from nonexistant item. (or crashed)
//
//                      VERSION 1.4.21
//
// 6.02.01
//      - Added support for Shift-Right click extended Context Menus
//

//      - Added two ContextMenu related functions:
//          function ContextMenuItemHelp(MenuItemID: integer): WideString;
//          function ContextMenuVerb(MenuItemID: integer): WideString;
//        The first retrieves the Help string assiciated with the item ID the second
//        retrieves the verb assiciated with the menu item.  These functions will only
//        retrieve valid data when a context menu is open.

//        retrieve the icon.  Allows VET to discriminate whether it should add
//        the namespace to the thread queue or if is is already there.
//      - Fixed some memory leaks again thank you MemProof <g>
