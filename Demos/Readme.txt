

Welcome to the VirtualShellTools Demo Folder!

These are the Demo supplied with VirtualShellTools.  If you want to compile all the demos at once then use the *.bpg file supplied in this folder.  
VirtualShellToolsDemos.bpg  			-  All the Demos having to do with VirtualShellTools

In order to build the package open the *.bpg file with Delphi.  Answer yes to *all* the annoying quesions about recreating the resource file.  Go to 

View -> ProjectManager

You should see all the demos in the Listview.  Use the dropdown list and select the first item in the list. Delphi will open the project.  Close the project. All you need is the original ProjectManager but with the first demo selected in the dropdown list.  Now go to 

Project -> Compile All Projects

Delphi will start churning away compiling all the projects in the list.

Go to the Demos folder and start seeing what VirtualShellTools can do for you.
